# Wikipedia-like API – Productionized with Kubernetes & Helm

## Overview

This project productionizes a simplified Wikipedia-like API service that allows users to create users and posts. The service is built using ""FastAPI"" and has been containerized and deployed on ""Kubernetes"" using ""Helm"". The system is designed to be lightweight, observable, and production-ready within constrained resources.

The application exposes Prometheus metrics to track the total number of users and posts created, which are visualized using Grafana dashboards.
